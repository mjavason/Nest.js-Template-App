Using the dbdiagram.io types below, follow the structure strictly in that exact same text format and create a database design for the app i'll describe. Im not asking for a database schema, just follow the types i've shown below and map it. Just leave enums as strings, they do not exist for the tech im working with, do not try to show the types, just leave as string. do not do this role string -- 'Customer' or 'Courier', just leave as string. Remember, keep it in the same format as below. do not add any comments. just leave it bare. Give it to me in the text like format, the way it is below
// Docs: https://dbml.dbdiagram.io/docs

Table follows {
  following_user_id integer
  followed_user_id integer
  created_at timestamp
}

Table users {
  id integer [primary key]
  username varchar
  role varchar
  created_at timestamp
}

Table posts {
  id integer [primary key]
  title varchar
  body text [note: 'Content of the post']
  user_id integer [not null]
  status varchar
  created_at timestamp
}

Ref user_posts: posts.user_id > users.id // many-to-one

Ref: users.id < follows.following_user_id

Ref: users.id < follows.followed_user_id
